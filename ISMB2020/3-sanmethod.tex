\subsection{Gene expression}
To validated the proposed idea, TCGA RNAseq cancer (n=9566) and
clinical samples for 33 cancers were downloaded from UCSC Xena
database (https://xenabrowser.net). TCGA processed raw RNAseq data
using Illumina HiSeq 2000 RNA sequencing platform where per-gene
normalized abundance estimation were calculated with FPKM method.
RNASeq normalized counts were then log transformed after adding a
constant of 1. Later UCSC re-processed using GENCODE v23 transcript
